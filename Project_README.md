# Flight Delay Prediction Project
This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Contains the dataset files (`Train.csv`, `Test.csv`, etc.).
- `models/` - Stores trained models.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `scripts/` - Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `docs/` - Documentation, reports, and presentation files.

## Uses
1. Used `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb` to explore data.
2. Used `notebooks/02_data_cleaning_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean and preprocess data.
3. Trained a baseline model in `notebooks/03_baseline_model.ipynb`.
4. Experimented with advanced models in `notebooks/04_advanced_models.ipynb`.
5. Evaluated model performance in `notebooks/05_model_evaluation.ipynb`.
6. Trained the final model in `notebooks/06_final_model_training.ipynb`.
7. Generated predictions for submission in `notebooks/07_submission_generation.ipynb`.
